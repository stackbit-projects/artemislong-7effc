    content: "##### Artem Long Dinh (EN)\_- Dinh Tien Long (VN)\_- Артём Динь Шоновичь (RU)\n\n\n\nHi friend! I'm Artem, also known as\_Artyom or Long. I study Biomedical Engineering at Tufts University (class of 2023), and\_my current favorite BME topics are neural engineering, diagnostic platforms. I also enjoy learning and practicing tech\_entrepreneurship by tinkering with ideas\_and actualizing them with cool people through [Projects](#).\n\nWhen I get off the computer, I hover around\_the city I live in and do urban exploration (legally), binge sci-fi, or simply have fun with my friends. Some conversations excite me more than others such as\_East Asian history and architecture, world geopolitics, and what distinguishes\_humans from snails. I document some of my thoughts and stories in [Blog](#).\n\nI am happy to meet new people, new ideas, and new opportunities, so don't hesitate to contact me\_at <tien_long.dinh@tufts.edu>. I hope you will enjoy learning about some of my work and thoughts on this website!\n"
