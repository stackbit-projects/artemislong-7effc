Inspired by a famous sock puppet meme by Florkofcows, I created Thang Than Lan page with my friends where we drew funny and sarcastic single-page comics about ordinary Vietnamese life, anime, games, and other geeky stuff. Surprisingly, content about social and historical topics gained popularity among the audience as we were among the few Vietnamese comic pages that offered such content at that time.

Later on, we focused on satire and sarcastic meme-comics about global and Vietnamese history, society, and politics, and our fanbase grew at an unexpected rate. Therefore, our next move was creating a community group to encourage members to create their own webcomics about any topic of interest as well as to exchange knowledge and ideas about relevant topics.

Managing and building Thang Than Lan for over 2 years had been an amazing experience for me. I met and made friends with people from all over Vietnam with different beliefs and points of view; I learned to express my ideas and thoughts in a respectful and considerable manner, considering the diverse audience that would see my work; and I also understood my country and society better as I dived deeper into the topics I drew about.

Even though I no longer manage the page, the page is still active and growing under the new generation of moderators, and recently it reached 53,000 followers. The only thing that hasn't changed is my silly and kind-of-ugly drawing skill.

###### P/s: making satire content about Vietnamese politics, especially the Party, wasn't a good idea at all. But, we were a bunch of careless teenagers, so we couldn't help but do it.&#xA;

Below are some of my works.
