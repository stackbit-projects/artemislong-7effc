Hi friend! I'm Artem, also known as Artyom or Long. I study Biomedical Engineering at Tufts University (class of 2023), and my current favorite BME topics are neural engineering, diagnostic platforms. I also enjoy learning and practicing tech entrepreneurship by tinkering with ideas and actualizing them with cool people through [Projects](#).

When I get off the computer, I hover around the city I live in and do urban exploration (legally), binge scifi, or simply have fun with my friends. Some conversations excite me more than others such as East Asian history and architecture, world geopolitics, and what distinguishes humans from snails. I document some of my thoughts and stories in [Blog](#).

I am happy to meet new people, new ideas, and new opportunities, so don't hesitate to contact me at <tien_long.dinh@tufts.edu>. I hope you will enjoy learning about some of my work and thoughts on this website!
